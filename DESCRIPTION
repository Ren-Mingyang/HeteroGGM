Description: Gaussian graphical model-based heterogeneity analysis:
             Recently, several Gaussian graphical model (GGM)-based heterogeneity 
             analysis techniques have been developed. A common methodological limitation 
             is that the number of subgroups is assumed to be known a priori, which 
             is not realistic. In a very recent study (Ren et al., 2021), a novel approach 
             based on the penalized fusion technique is developed to fully 
             data-dependently determine the number and structure of subgroups in 
             GGM-based heterogeneity analysis. It opens the door for utilizing 
             the GGM technique in more practical settings. The goal of this 
             package is to user-friendly realizing this approach. Beyond 
             Ren et al. (2021), more estimations and functions are added, so 
             that the package is self-contained and more comprehensive and can 
             provide ``more direct'' insights to practitioners (with the 
             visualization function). Reference:
